                  Malik bin Deenar or Malik Ibn Dinar was a Tabi‘in who is famous for being the first to bring Islam to India. In 624 AD, Malik Ibn Deenar and 12 of his trade associates landed in Kerala. Their mission was not just trade but to propagate Islam in other parts of the world. The delegation consisted of Sharaf Ibn Malik, his brother Malik Ibn Deenar and his nephew Malik Ibn Habeeb Ibn Malik.  The mission reached at Kanhirakode (now Kasaragod).  Their distinct way of trade and the propagation of Islam soon attracted the attention of the then ruler Cheraman Perumal. On enquiry, Malik Bin Deenar and his comrades related the reason for their honest trade practices to be their recent conversion to Islam.</div>
